/*
	We will use the 5 points on the book to code    
	
        1. Initialize w0 = w1 = 1

	2. w0 and w1 should be updated in every iteration in a way such that J(w0, w1) gradually decreases.  

	3. After a certain point the value of J(w0, w1) will not decrease significantly- in 4-5 iterations the value will not go below 		   0.001. Stop running the loop then. 

	4. The minimal values of w0 and w1 obtained are the optimal values for which we get min J(w0, w1). 

	5. Plug in the new values of w0 and w1 in the hypothesis.
